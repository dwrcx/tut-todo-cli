# Todo CLI in Go

This follows a tutorial from the book [Powerful Command Line Applications in Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/rggo/), written by Ricardo Gerardi.

## Learning Objectives  
- Structuring a simple CLI in Go without a framework  
- Handling user input and command-line arguments  
- Managing file-based storage for tasks (JSON)

**A couple of things I'd like to wire up after the tutorial:**
- Extending the CLI to use SQLite instead of JSON  
- Implementing a migration path from JSON to SQLite
